# Tic Tac Toe üéÆ

Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe**, a classic game built with **React**! This project follows React's best practices and serves as a learning exercise for building interactive UIs.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Classic gameplay**: Enjoy the classic Tic-Tac-Toe experience.
- **Move history**: Revisit past moves to learn and strategize.
- **Move sorting**: Toggle move history between ascending and descending order.
- **Winning highlights**: Visualize the winning line when a player wins.
- **Draw detection**: Know when the match ends in a tie.
- **Move locations**: View the row and column of each move in the history.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview

This application uses the following:

- **React functional components** with hooks for state management.
- Modular structure with reusable components (`Board`, `Square`).
- **Custom utility functions** for win detection and formatting data.
- Clean and responsive UI.

### Key React Concepts Used:

- **State lifting**: Sharing state between `Game`, `Board`, and `Square`.
- **Immutability**: Creating new state objects without mutating existing ones.
- **Conditional rendering**: Dynamic UI updates based on game state.
- **Map functions**: Rendering lists (moves and squares) dynamically.
